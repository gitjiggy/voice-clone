# 🧹 **Clean Slate Demo Script**
## **Complete Reset & Fresh Start Workflow**

---

## 🎯 **Purpose**
Demonstrate the complete data cleanup system that ensures no leftover audio clips or training data pollutes new voice training sessions.

---

## 🔧 **Clean Slate Features**

### **Backend Endpoint: `/reset-training-data`**
- ✅ **Removes ALL audio clips**: `/data/processed/clip_*.wav`
- ✅ **Clears training dataset**: `/data/dataset.jsonl` 
- ✅ **Deletes trained models**: `/models/voice_clone/model.pth` + `config.json`
- ✅ **Removes generated outputs**: `/outputs/*.wav`
- ✅ **Cleans temporary files**: Any `temp_*.wav` files
- ✅ **Resets memory state**: Clears voice trainer and synthesizer status
- ✅ **Forces garbage collection**: Frees up RAM immediately

### **Frontend Reset Button**
- ✅ **Prominent placement**: Top-right of progress tracker
- ✅ **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental resets
- ✅ **Detailed breakdown**: Shows exactly what will be deleted
- ✅ **Progress indication**: Loading state during reset
- ✅ **Complete state reset**: Returns to Step 1 with clean UI
- ✅ **LocalStorage cleanup**: Removes all saved progress

## 📝 **Demo Workflow**

### **Step 1: Show Current State**
```bash
# Check current system state
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/clips

# Show existing files
ls -la /Users/nirajdesai/Documents/AI/voice-clone/data/processed/
ls -la /Users/nirajdesai/Documents/AI/voice-clone/models/voice_clone/
ls -la /Users/nirajdesai/Documents/AI/voice-clone/outputs/
```

### **Step 2: Execute Clean Slate (Backend)**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/reset-training-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "message": "Clean slate completed - ready for fresh training",
  "reset_summary": {
    "audio_clips": 5,
    "training_files": 1, 
    "model_files": 2,
    "output_files": 1,
    "temp_files": 0
  },
  "total_files_removed": 9,
  "status": "success",
  "next_steps": [
    "Record new audio clips (30+ clips recommended)",
    "Analyze dataset for quality validation",
    "Train voice model with clean data", 
    "Test voice synthesis"
  ]
}
```

### **Step 3: Verify Complete Cleanup**
```bash
# Verify all directories are empty
echo "=== Audio Clips ==="
ls -la /Users/nirajdesai/Documents/AI/voice-clone/data/processed/

echo "=== Models ==="  
ls -la /Users/nirajdesai/Documents/AI/voice-clone/models/voice_clone/

echo "=== Outputs ==="
ls -la /Users/nirajdesai/Documents/AI/voice-clone/outputs/

echo "=== Dataset ==="
ls -la /Users/nirajdesai/Documents/AI/voice-clone/data/dataset.jsonl
```

**Expected Result:**
```bash
=== Audio Clips ===
# Empty directory (only . and ..)

=== Models === 
# Empty directory (only . and ..)

=== Outputs ===
# Empty directory (only . and ..)

=== Dataset ===
# No such file or directory (removed)
```

### **Step 4: Frontend Demonstration**

1. **Open Frontend**: http://127.0.0.1:4001
2. **Show Reset Button**: Top-right corner of progress tracker
3. **Click Reset**: Opens confirmation dialog
4. **Review Warning**: Shows all data that will be deleted
5. **Confirm Reset**: Click "Reset Everything"
6. **Verify State**: UI returns to Step 1, all progress cleared

---

## 🚨 **Safety Features**

### **Confirmation Dialog**
- ⚠️ **Clear warning**: "This action cannot be undone"
- 📋 **Detailed list**: Shows exactly what gets deleted
- 🔒 **Double confirmation**: Requires explicit button click
- ⏳ **Loading state**: Prevents multiple requests
- ❌ **Easy cancel**: Clear escape option

### **Graceful Error Handling**
- 🛡️ **File permission errors**: Logs warnings, continues cleanup
- 🔄 **Partial failures**: Reports what was successfully removed
- 💾 **Memory safety**: Force garbage collection after cleanup
- 📝 **Audit trail**: Complete logging of all operations

## 🎬 **Hackathon Demo Script**

### **"Fresh Start" Demo (2 minutes)**

```
"Let me show you something important for hackathon reliability - 
our clean slate system.

[Show existing data in browser and terminal]

As you can see, we have audio clips, trained models, and outputs 
from previous sessions. For a hackathon demo, you want to ensure 
NO leftover data pollutes your fresh training.

[Click Reset button in UI]

Watch this - one click opens a confirmation dialog that shows 
exactly what will be deleted. This prevents accidents but makes 
cleanup fast.

[Confirm reset]

[Show terminal verification]

Perfect! In seconds, we've completely cleaned:
• 5 audio clips
• 1 training dataset  
• 2 model files
• 1 output file

The system is now in a pristine state - ready for your actual 
voice recording and training. No contamination from test data or 
previous attempts.

This is critical for hackathon success - you want clean, 
reproducible results that judges can trust."
```
